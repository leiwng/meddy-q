## Our Vision

Companies like OpenAI built "Super AI" that threatens human independence. We crave individuality: AI that amplifies, not erases, **YOU**.

We‚Äôre challenging that with "**Second Me**": an open-source prototype where you craft your own **AI self**‚Äîa new AI species that preserves you, delivers your context, and defends your interests.

It‚Äôs **locally trained and hosted**‚Äîyour data, your control‚Äîyet **globally connected**, scaling your intelligence across an AI network. Beyond that, it‚Äôs your AI identity interface‚Äîa bold standard linking your AI to the world, sparks collaboration among AI selves, and builds tomorrow‚Äôs truly native AI apps.

Tech enthusiasts, AI pros, domain experts, Join us! Second Me is your launchpad to extend your mind into the digital horizon.

## Key Features

### **Train Your AI Self** with AI-Native Memory ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08102))
Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

</p>


### **Scale Your Intelligence** on the Second Me Network
Launch your AI self from your laptop onto our decentralized network‚Äîanyone or any app can connect with your permission, sharing your context as your digital identity.

## Quick Start

### üìä Model Deployment Memory and Supported Model Size Reference Guide

*Note: "B" in the table represents "billion parameters model". Data shown are examples only; actual supported model sizes may vary depending on system optimization, deployment environment, and other hardware/software conditions.*

| Memory (GB) | Docker Deployment (Windows/Linux) | Docker Deployment (Mac) | Integrated Setup (Windows/Linux) | Integrated Setup (Mac) |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 8            | ~0.8B (example)                | ~0.4B (example)       | ~1.0B (example)              | ~0.6B (example)    |
| 16           | 1.5B (example)                 | 0.5B (example)        | ~2.0B (example)              | ~0.8B (example)    |
| 32           | ~2.8B (example)                | ~1.2B (example)       | ~3.5B (example)              | ~1.5B (example)    |

> **Note**: Models below 0.5B may not provide satisfactory performance for complex tasks. And we're continuously improving cross-platform support - please [submit an issue](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/issues/new) for feedback or compatibility problems on different operating systems.

> **MLX Acceleration**: Mac M-series users can use [MLX](https://github.com/mindverse/Second-Me/tree/master/lpm_kernel/L2/mlx_training) to run larger models (CLI-only).

### üê≥ Option 1: Docker Setup 

> **Note**: Docker setup on Mac M-Series chips has 25-30% performance overhead compared to integrated setup, but offers easier installation process.

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
  - For Docker installation: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - For Docker Compose installation: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

- For Windows Users: You can use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) to run `make` commands. You may need to modify the Makefile by replacing Unix-specific commands with Windows-compatible alternatives.

- Memory Usage Settings (important):
  - Configure these settings in Docker Desktop (macOS) or Docker Desktop (Windows) at: Dashboard -> Settings -> Resources
  - Make sure to allocate sufficient memory resources (at least 8GB recommended)

#### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Start the containers
```bash
make docker-up
```

3. After starting the service (either with local setup or Docker), open your browser and visit:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

4. View help and more commands
```bash
make help
```

5. For custom Ollama model configuration, please refer to:
   [Custom Model Config(Ollama)](docs/Custom%20Model%20Config%28Ollama%29.md)


### üöÄ Option 2: Integrated Setup (Non-Docker)

> **Note**: Integrated Setup provides best performance, especially for larger models, as it runs directly on your host system without containerization overhead.

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed on your system
- Node.js 18+ and npm installed
- Basic build tools (cmake, make, etc.)

#### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Mindverse/Second-Me.git
cd Second-Me
```

2. Run the integrated setup (installs all dependencies and prepares the environment)
```bash
make setup
```

3. Start all services
```bash
make restart
```

4. After services are started, open your browser and visit:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

> üí° **Advantages**: This method offers better performance than Docker on Mac & Linux systems while still providing a simple setup process. It installs directly on your host system without containerization overhead. (Windows not tested)
